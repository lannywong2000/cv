            I am a first-year Master of Computer Science student at the
            University of California, Irvine. I received my Bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science & Technology from the South China University of
            Technology in China with a minor certificate in Finance. During my
            undergraduate, I attended the University of California, Berkeley for
            an international study program and aced two computer science courses
            with a heavy workload. My education experience has equipped me with
            competent computer programming and problem-solving skills, which
            were put to test by interning as a software engineer at WeChat,
            Tencent. The internship solidates and intensifies my passion to
            become a professional software engineer. Please feel welcome to
